      "flavour_text": "The Hegemony is a martial successor state to the Domain formed by a 'lost legion' trapped in a backwater system by the collapse of the Domain gate network. Built upon a creative interpretation of protocols which indefinitely extends Domain-style martial law, the founders of the Hegemony believed that the overriding cause of restoring the Domain and therefore stability, peace, and prosperity to the Sector and indeed the entire galaxy must come before certain niceties of human rights. The survival of humanity is at stake and it is only the discipline of the Hegemony military that protects worlds where some semblance of the normalcy of human civilization can be nurtured. Anything that threatens the Great Cause must be neutralized; if a few activists must be discouraged for the greater good, so be it. \n\nCivilian hierarchies exist to govern the planets and stations under Hegemony rule but are entirely subordinate to the military. The specifics of civilian organization varies between worlds, as was Domain policy. When in doubt, the Hegemony applies a modified Domain-era colonial charter to dictate political organization. This standard-charter civilian hierarchy is generally elected, however as per martial law valid candidates must be approved by the local military authority. Exceptional times require exceptional measures, yet still the Hegemony fosters the flickering flame of galactic democracy under the same principles that founded the Domain.",
